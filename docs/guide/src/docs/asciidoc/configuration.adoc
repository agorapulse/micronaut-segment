You need to provide `segment.api-key` configuration property to send information to Segment.

[source,yaml]
----
include::{root-dir}/libs/micronaut-segment/src/test/resources/application-example.yml[]
----
<1> Segment API key is required if you want to send records to Segment but can be ignored in the development environment
<2> The legacy default options `id`, `language`, `user-agent` or `intercom`, use <<Message Transformation>> instead

You can rely on `SegmentService` bean being always present but if the API key is missing then no-op implementation is provided.
